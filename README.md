Note
=================
Since I took a long screen shot for the good.png and bad.png, the sidebar looks a bit weired. It should always stick to the
right side of the window.

Reference
=================
Sidebar CSS style from https://dev.to/clairecodes/how-to-make-a-sticky-sidebar-with-two-lines-of-css-2ki7

1.html, 2.html, 3.html from http://www.gutenberg.org/browse/scores/top

Modifications in part 1
=================
For each html (1.html, 2.html, 3.html), I add a css file link in the head and apply the css theme to the html files. The css file
name is "theme.css" in the gutenburg directory. 

For the picture part, I delete the original style applied directly on the images in the html files and apply a class called ".image" to the pictures.
